Description: Implements the Welch-Satterthwaite approximation for differences
    of non-standardized t-distributed random variables in both univariate and 
    multivariate settings. The package provides methods for computing effective
    degrees of freedom and scale parameters, as well as distribution functions
    for the approximated difference distribution. The methodology extends the
    classical Welch-Satterthwaite framework from variance combinations to
    t-distribution differences through careful moment matching.
